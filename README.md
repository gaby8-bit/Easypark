# Easypark
In this app I try to resolve a common problem in our days:the problem of finding a parking place in a crowded city.
I created this app in C# and in it I create the possibility to create an user account and to book a parking place,of course it is just the begining for an app like this.
And it works like this :in the start page you can login or register and after that in another page you will se the empty parking places and you can choose which place you want and in which time interval.
I think if I make this app more developed, it will be a good contribution at the finding a parking spot in a crowded city.
And of course like this we can redouce the pollution in the big cities.
